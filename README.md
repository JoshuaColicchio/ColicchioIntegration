# ColicchioIntegration
Joshua Colicchio Integration Project for COP 2006

Disclaimer - Git says there are two contributers, but they're both me. My home computer was logged into my old git account when I pulled the repository, and I didn't catch it until recently. So half of the commits are from my official account, and the other half are from my original account. I didn't want you to see that and think I've got another guy writing this for me.
